		"description" : "The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historic significance, the most famous being the Parthenon. The word acropolis is from the Greek words akron means highest point and  polis means city. Although the term acropolis is generic and there are many other acropoleis in Greece, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as The Acropolis without qualification. During ancient times it was known also more properly as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent-man, Cecrops, the first Athenian king."

		"description" : "Antonis Tritsis, the Environmental Awareness Park, is located at the western edge of urban Athens, at Ilion. Located at Pyrgos Vassilissis and spanning some 1,200 hectares, this park constitutes the largest green zone in all of Attica.Water is one of the key themes here. A specially designed system ensures continuous recirculation of fresh water between the park’s six lakes. This abundance of water has helped promote and preserve the park’s rich biodiversity. It has also become something of an incubator of ideas for those in the government who determine environmental policy. Antonis Tritsis is a gem of simple, natural beauty, a welcome respite from Athens’ booming construction and urbanisation."
